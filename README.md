## Purpose

This [web application](https://bit.ly/medixn) lists all possible combinations of medications. 

This does not return interactions between medications; see the [Drug Interaction Checker](https://reference.medscape.com/drug-interactionchecker) by Medscape.

This tool only lists possible combinations of medications.

This can be helpful when preparing medical documents, e.g., medication petitions.

## Medications

Enter the names of medications, separated by commas.

Alternatively, click through some of the provided default medications commonly used in psychiatry.

## Number of Medications to Combine

Select how many different medications to combine, ranging from 2 to 10; the default is 2.

## Search by Medicine

Search combinations for a specific medicine by entering the name into the search field.

Note, medications with similar names can be selected unintentionally.

e.g., searching "haldol" will show both "haldol" and "haldol decanoate"

## Select the Combinations

Once a table is generated, click the desired rows of medication combinations. 

Hold down the `command` key (`control` key on Windows PC), and click to highlight multiple desired rows.

## Copy

Click the `Copy` button to copy highlighted medication combinations to the clipboard, which can then be pasted into Microsoft Word.

Note, if the entire table is desired, click the `Copy` button without highlighting any rows.
